        "1": "Identify Catastrophic Thinking Patterns: We will start by identifying the situations that trigger your catastrophic thinking, such as feeling that all the animals at the shelter hate you because a few didn't remember you. We will explore the thoughts and beliefs that contribute to this pattern.",
        "2": "Challenge Negative Beliefs: Once we have identified these patterns, we will work on challenging the negative beliefs associated with catastrophizing. We will examine evidence that supports and contradicts these beliefs to develop a more balanced perspective.",
        "3": "Reframing: We will practice reframing your thoughts about the situation at the animal shelter. For example, instead of assuming that the animals hate you, we will focus on more balanced and realistic interpretations of their behavior.",
        "4": "Behavioral Experiments: To test the validity of your catastrophic thoughts, we may engage in behavioral experiments. These experiments will help you gather evidence to challenge your initial beliefs and develop more adaptive thinking patterns.",
        "5": "Homework Assignments: I may assign you homework tasks to practice decatastrophizing on your own outside of our sessions. These assignments will help strengthen the skills and strategies we discuss during our counseling sessions."
